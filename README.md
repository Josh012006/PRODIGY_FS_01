## About the project

This is a secure authentication system. The user's information is kept private and can only be accessed by him.
The frontend is done with create-react-app and using Tailwind CSS for the style and responsiveness. The backend is done with express and using a MySQL database.

This project shows my understanding of authentication problem and also my capacity to establish a strong routage in an app.

## How to start

You can first **clone** the repository.
Then go to the client folder and run **npm install**. Do the same thing in the server folder.

The next step is to fill the .env file in the server folder.
Here are the needed variables:

PORT=
DB_HOST=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=
JWT_SECRET=

Now to run the app, go to the **server folder and run npm run dev** and then go to the **client folder and run npm start**.
